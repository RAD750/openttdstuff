# OpenTTD Stuff
This repo contains (most of) my NewGRFs for OpenTTD. Currently there are two completed GRFs and two WIP thingys.

## Completed
* **E652**: A powerful electric locomotive for mixed traffic duties. [Wikipedia](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotiva_FS_E652)
* **EB 740** An electric railcar that is able to operate on its own, in multiple units or combined with normal railway coaches. [Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotrice_FNM_E.740)
